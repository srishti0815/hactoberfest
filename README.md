# hactoberfest
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, Quality is key), we have provided examples of the quality standards we discourage. This applies mainly to beginners.

PRs that are automated e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace / optimize images.
PRs that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR.
PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
Submitting your name or text to a markdown file for the sole purpose of creating a PR.
Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October.
Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not.

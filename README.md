# hactoberfest
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, Quality is key), we have provided examples of the quality standards we discourage. This applies mainly to beginners.

PRs that are automated e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace / optimize images.
PRs that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR.
PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
Submitting your name or text to a markdown file for the sole purpose of creating a PR.
Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October.
Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not.
We ask all participants to read through the details to ensure that the global community is working towards a shared goal. Thanks for honoring the values and following the rules of participation.

Values
As we enter our fifth year, we present the Hacktoberfest values. These have been crafted by you, the community, through your actions and stories. All we have done is highlight them.
